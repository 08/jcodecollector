jcodecollector
==============

jCodeCollector is a simple snippets manager for Mac OS X, Windows and Linux developed by me (Alessandro Cocco) in my free time.  Latest stable version (2.5) has been released in January 2011. I have no time to continue the development of jCodeCollector so I released it as open source (September 2012).  Thanks you all for your interest!
